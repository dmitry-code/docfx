## Alert
**Ransomware indicators detected**

## Description
Analysis of host data indicates suspicious activity traditionally associated with lock-screen and encryption ransomware. Lock screen ransomware displays a full-screen message preventing interactive use of the host and access to its files. Encryption ransomware prevents access by encrypting data files. In both cases a ransom message is typically displayed, requesting payment in order to restore file access.

## Recommendation
**Sensitive data in your SQL databases should be classified**

## Description & related policy
Azure SQL Database Data discovery & classification provides capabilities for discovering, classifying, labeling, and protecting the sensitive data in your databases. Once your data is classified, you can use Azure SQL Database auditing to audit access and monitor the sensitive data. Azure SQL Database also enables Advanced Threat Protection features which creates intelligent alerts based on changes in the access patterns to the sensitive data.<br>(Related policy: [Preview]: Sensitive data in your SQL databases should be classified)

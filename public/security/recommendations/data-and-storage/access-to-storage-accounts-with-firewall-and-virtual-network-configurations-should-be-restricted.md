## Recommendation
**Access to storage accounts with firewall and virtual network configurations should be restricted**

## Description & related policy
Audit unrestricted network access in your storage account firewall settings. Instead, configure network rules so only applications from allowed networks can access the storage account. To allow connections from specific Internet or on-premises clients, you can grant access to traffic from specific Azure virtual networks or to public Internet IP address ranges.<br>(Related policy: Audit unrestricted network access to storage accounts)

## Recommendation
**Secure transfer to storage accounts should be enabled**

## Description & related policy
Secure transfer is an option that forces your storage account to accept requests only from secure connections (HTTPS). HTTPS ensures authentication between the server and the service and protects data in transit from network layer attacks such as man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping, and session-hijacking.<br>(Related policy: Secure transfer to storage accounts should be enabled)

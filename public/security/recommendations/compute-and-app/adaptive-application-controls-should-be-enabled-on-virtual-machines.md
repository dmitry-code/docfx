## Recommendation
**Adaptive Application Controls should be enabled on virtual machines**

## Description & related policy
Enable application control to control which applications can run on your VMs located in Azure. This will help harden your VMs against malware. Security Center uses machine learning to analyze the applications running on each VM and helps you apply allow rules using this intelligence. This capability simplifies the process of configuring and maintaining application allow rules.<br>(Related policy: Adaptive Application Controls should be enabled on virtual machines)
